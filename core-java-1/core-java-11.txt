core java - java 11 features

What is openjdk?

-	The openjdk is a free version of java available from java 11 onwards.

Explain how to run a java program?

-	Till java 10 version we need to compile the java program and then execute it.

-	We use javac command with file name to compile the java program and java command with class name to execute it.

	Example:
	
	# javac Myprogram.java
	# java Myprogram

-	From java 11 version onwards we can execute java program directly without compilation by using java command with file name.

	Example:
	
	# java Myprogram.java
	
-	The single java command does both compilation and execution.

-	However with backward compatibility, we can use javac command with file name to compile the java program and java command with class name to execute it.

-	There is a possibility of multiple non public classes with main method exists inside single java file.

-	Then upon execution jvm will search for main method inside each class defined from top to bottom inside the java file.

-	Then jvm executes the main method of first found class with main method inside it. 

	Example:
	
	Myprogram.java
	
	class A {
	
	}
	
	class B {
	
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			
			System.out.println("Inside main method of class B");
		}
	}
	
	class C {
	
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			
			System.out.println("Inside main method of class C");
		}
	}
	
	class D {
	
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			
			System.out.println("Inside main method of class D");
		}
	}
	
	# java Myprogram.java
	
	Inside main method of class B
	
Explain the utility methods inside String class?

-	Below are different utility methods inside String class.

-	public String repeat(int count)

-	This method returns a result string object after repeated concatenation for count number of times of the input string object.

	Example:
	
	String input = "durga";
	
	input.repeat(5);	//durgadurgadurgadurgadurga

-	When the count parameter is zero then this method returns empty string object.

-	When the count parameter is negative then we will get runtime exception saying IllegalArguementException.

-	public boolean isBlank()

-	This method returns true when input string object is empty or has only white spaces otherwise returns false. 

-	Another method public boolean isEmpty() was introduced in java version 6.

-	It returns true if the input string object length is zero otherwise it enters false.

-	However input string object has only white spaces then this method will return false.

	Example:
	
	String input = "    ";
	
	input.isBlank();	//true

	input.isEmpty();	//false

-	public String strip()

-	This method returns a result string object after removing white spaces at both beginning and end of the input string object.

-	public String stripLeading()

-	This method returns a result string object after removing white spaces at beginning of the input string object.

-	public String stripTrailing()

-	This method returns a result string object after removing white spaces at end of the input string object.

-	public Stream lines()

-	This method returns a stream of string objects extracted from the input string object separated by line terminator character.

	Example:
	
	String input = "durga\nsoftware\nsolutions";
	
	Stream<String> streamOfLines = input.lines();
