core java - reactive programming

What is reactive?

-	Reactive is a programming paradigm.

-	A reactive program must be responsive, resilient, elastic and message driven.

What is RxJava?

-	RxJava is an implementation to reactive programming specification.

-	It was developed by netflix developers.

-	It follows the push mechanism instead of pull mechanism.

-	It uses observer design pattern.

-	It uses different channels for different signals.

-	It allows to compose events using operators.

-	It supports scheduler for parallel programming.

-	It is backpressure ready.

What is concurrency and parallelism?

-	The term concurrency is the act of managing and running multiple processes together.

-	It is achieved through interleaved processes running.

-	A single processor does context switching between the processes.

-	The term parallelism is the act of running multiple processes simultaneously.

-	It is achieved through multiple processors.

-	Each processor is running single process hence multiple processes can run simultaneously on different processor.

What does asynchronous mean?

-	The term asynchronous mean execution of child program independent of the parent program flow.

-	The parent program does not wait until the child program execution is complete.

-	This is acheieved using callback.

-	The callback is similar to goto statement and hence it will cause difficulty in debugging.

-	Hence RxJava uses observer design pattern instead of callback.

What is observer design pattern?

-	In observer design pattern one object will change its state then all the dependent objects will be notified about this change.

-	RxJava uses observer design pattern instead of callback.
