core java - problem solving

Explain the power of three problem with solution?

-	The problem statement is given an integer n return true if x exist such that n = 3 ^ x.

-	The range for n -2 ^ 31 <= n <= 2 ^ 31 - 1. 3 ^ x will always yeild positive result hence range for n becomes 1 <= n <= 2 ^ 31 - 1.

-	3 ^ 19 is equal to 1162261467 which is maximum value possible for n of datatype integer.

-	Therefore n = 3 ^ x to be true then 1162261467 should be completely divisible by any value of n.

	Example:
	
	return (n > 0) ? (1162261467 % n == 0) : false;
