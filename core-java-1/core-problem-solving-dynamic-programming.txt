core java - problem solving using dynamic programming

What is recursion?

-	A recursion is a problem solving technique in which solution to one larger problem is derived from solution to one or more smaller and similar problem.

-	It involves breaking a large problem into smaller problems.

-	Every problem can be solved using iteration or recursion.

-	Using recursion a method calls itself.

-	It becomes necessary to include a base condition inside the method to exit from the recursive method calls. 

What is backtracking?

-	Backtracking is a form of recursion.

-	It is used to solve constraint satisfaction problems i.e. finding all possible solutions for a problem.

-	These problem can be solved using a tree structure called as game tree or potential search tree.

-	Each child node differ from its parent by a single extension only.

-	Each leaf node cannot be extended further.

-	The backtracking algorithm traverse the tree from root to leaf using depth first search.

-	It is better than brute force because within one method call it can eliminate one or more bad states.
