Explain the longest substring without repeating character problem with solution?

-	The problem statement is given a string find the length of longest substring without repeating characters.

-	The solution to this problem is using sliding window or two pointers to traverse the string.

-	Fix the left pointer at one index and move the right pointer to traverse the string.

-	At each step the occurrence of a character is noted inside a hashmap.

-	Also determine the final maximum length of the substring.

-	When the right pointer reaches an element where the substring contains duplicate character then we move the left pointer to next index after the first occurrence of that duplicate character.

	Example:

    int index = charToIndexMap.getOrDefault(tokens[rightPtr], -1);
    if (index >= leftPtr) {
        leftPtr = index + 1;
    } else {
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, 1 + rightPtr - leftPtr);
    }
    charToIndexMap.put(tokens[rightPtr], rightPtr);
    rightPtr++;

Explain the longest substring with each character repeating atleast k times problem with solution?

-	The problem statement is given a string find the length of longest substring with each character repeating atleast k times.

-	The possible solution to this problem is using sliding window or two pointers to traverse the string.

-	Fix the left pointer at one index and move the right pointer to traverse the string.

-	Consider below case where k = 3 and right pointer reaches an element where count of character 'a' is equal to k. 

	b b a a a c b d
	^		^
	l		r
	
-	But the count of character 'b' is less than k hence we move the right pointer ahead.

-	Now the count of character 'a' and 'b' both is equal to k but the substring now contains character 'c' with count less than k.

	b b a a a c b d
	^		    ^
	l		    r

-	It is unclear whether the window must expand or shrink, therefore the sliding window or two pointers strategy will not work.

-	The solution to this problem is using divide and conquer technique.

-	First step is to traverse the entire string from left to right and noting the ocurrence and latest index of each character inside two different hashmaps.

-	Next find the first character which repeats less than k number of times and find its index i.

-	Divide the string into two parts from index 0 till index i - 1 and index i + 1 till the last index.

-	Recursively repeat the same step until a substring with each character repeating atleast k times is found.

-	Also determine the final maximum length of the substring.

	Example:
	
	private void getMaxLengthSubstring(String input, int k) {
        ...
        if (null == charWithFreqLessThanK) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, input.length()); 
            return;
        }
        int sindex = 0;
        int eindex = indexMap.get(charWithFreqLessThanK);
        getMaxLengthSubstring(input.substring(sindex, eindex), k);
        sindex = eindex + 1;
        getMaxLengthSubstring(input.substring(sindex), k);
    }
	
Explain the longest duplicate substring  problem with solution?

-	The problem statement is given a string find the longest duplicate substring.

-	The solution to this problem is using binary search algorithm and Rabin Karp's algorithm.

-	Using binary search we determine the window length for a substring.

-	It depends on the idea that if a duplicate substring of length N exist then we must check for duplicate substring of length N + 1.

-	If duplicate substring of length N + 1 exist we must check for duplicate substring of length N + 2, this continues till the length of entire string.

-	But if a duplicate substring of length N + 1 doesn't exist then duplicate substring of length N is longest duplicate substring.

-	Rabin Karp's algorithm uses the principle of hashing to compare two substrings and determine whether they are identical or not.

-	Consider a string 'banana' and window of length 3. Therefore the hash of substring 'ban' is calculated as below using a random prime number.

	b								a								n 
	Math.pow(PRIME, 2) * 'b' 	+	Math.pow(PRIME, 1) * 'a' 	+ 	Math.pow(PRIME, 0) * 'n' = hash
	
-	For the first substring the hash calculation time complexity is equal to O(n) where n is the substring length.

-	For every next substring the hash calculation time complexity is equal to O(1) as we can reuse the previous computed hash.

	hash = hash - Math.pow(PRIME, 2) * 'b' 

	hash = hash * PRIME

	hash = hash + Math.pow(PRIME, 0) * 'a'

	Example:
	
	...
    while (low < high) {
		...
        String duplicate = getDuplicateString(input, mid);
        if (null != duplicate) {
            low = mid + 1;
            longestDuplicate = duplicate;
        } else {
            high = mid;
        }
    }
	
     
    private String getDuplicateString(String input, int len) {
		...
		Pair<Long, Long> hashPowerPair = getHashPowerPair(input.substring(0, len));
		...
		hash = getNextHash(hash, power, input.charAt(i - 1), input.charAt(i + len - 1));
		if (hashStore.contains(hash)) {
			return input.substring(i, i + len);
		}
    }
	
Explain the minimum window substring problem with solution?

-	The problem statement is given two strings input and target find the minimum window substring.

-	Find the minimum length substring from input string which contains all characters of target string.

-	The solution to this problem is using sliding window or two pointers.

-	First step is to note all characters and their occurrence in target string inside a hashmap.

-	Using left pointer and right pointer traverse the input string.

-	When a character with positive occurrence count is encountered it means the same character exist inside target string.

-	Increment the character from target string found counter value.

-	For every character in input string reduce its occurrence count inside the hashmap.

-	When the character from target string found counter value is equal to target string length it means substring between left pointer and right pointer is the required substring.

-	Next step is to shrink the substring by moving the left pointer until character from target string found counter value doesn't decrease.

-	As we move the left pointer for every character in substring increase its occurrence count inside the hashmap.

-	As the ocurrence count changes to positive again it means the substring cannot be shrinked further.

-	Decrement the character from target string found counter value.

	Example:
	
	while (rightPtr < input1.length()) {
        int freq = charFreqMap.getOrDefault(input1.charAt(rightPtr), 0);
        if (freq > 0) {
            foundCharCount++;
        }
        freq--;
        charFreqMap.put(input1.charAt(rightPtr), freq);
        while (foundCharCount == input2.length()) {
            String tempSubstr = input1.substring(leftPtr, rightPtr + 1);
            if ("".equals(substr) || tempSubstr.length() < substr.length()) {
                substr = tempSubstr;
            }
            freq = charFreqMap.get(input1.charAt(leftPtr));
            freq++;
            if (freq > 0) {
                foundCharCount--;
            }
            charFreqMap.put(input1.charAt(leftPtr), freq);
            leftPtr++;
        }   
		rightPtr++;
    }
