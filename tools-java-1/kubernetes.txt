kubernetes

What is kubernetes?

-	Orchestration means automated management of containers.

-	Kubernetes is container orchestration system.

-	For local development we must install minikube version of kubernetes.

What is a pod?

-	A pod is a wrapper around container.

-	It is short-lived.

-	One pod can contain one or more container but generally one pod contain only one container.

-	But in exception case one pod can contain one microservice container and one or more helper container.

-	Pod is not accessible outside the cluster.

-	Following command allows to list all pods.

	example:
	
	#kubectl get pods

-	Following command allows to describe a pod.

	syntax:
	
	#kubectl describe pod [name]
	
	example:
	
	#kubectl describe pod first-pod	
	
What is a service?

-	A service is middleman between pod and outside world.

-	It is long lived.

-	Following command allows to list all services.

	example:
	
	#kubectl get services

-	Following command allows to describe a service.

	syntax:
	
	#kubectl describe service [name]
	
	example:
	
	#kubectl describe service first-service

-	There are three types of service and they are called as ClusterIP, NodePort and LoadBalancer.

-	The role of service is to accept traffic from outside world or inside cluster.

-	Then redirect this traffic to the pod.

How does NodePort service work?

-	The NodePort service uses a nodePort and ClusterIP service.

-	It exposes nodePort on every node.

-	The outside world can directly send traffic on this nodePort.

-	The incoming traffic on nodePort is redirected to ClusterIP service.

-	Then ClusterIP service will redirect this traffic to the port used by pod.

What are labels and selectors?

-	The labels are key and value pairs which identify a pod.

-	Following command allows to list all pods with labels.

	example:
	
	#kubectl get pods --show-labels
	
-	Following command allows to find pod with a label.

	syntax:
	
	#kubectl get pods -l [key]=[value]

	example:
	
	#kubectl get pods -l app=first

-	The selectors are key and value pairs which help service to identify pod.

What is a replicaset?

-	A replicaset is count of pods running at any given time.

-	The pod defined inside the replicaset definition are owned by it.

-	It uses selectors to identify new pod added to the cluster which it must own.

-	Following command allows to list all replicaset.

	example:
	
	#kubectl get replicaset

-	Following command allows to describe a replicaset.

	syntax:
	
	#kubectl describe replicaset [name]
	
	example:
	
	#kubectl describe replicaset first-replicaset
