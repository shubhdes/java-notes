What is a job?

-	A pod enters into complete state when the container running inside it has completed the execution.

-	A job creates a pod and ensure it enters the complete state.

-	But a pod can enter into error state before completion.

-	The job identifies such pod and create a new pod as replacement. 

-	When a pod enter into complete state then the job also enters into complete state.

-	Following command allows to list all jobs.

	example:
	
	#kubectl get jobs

-	Following command allows to describe a job.

	syntax:
	
	#kubectl describe job [name]
	
	example:
	
	#kubectl describe job myjob
	
-	Following is yaml definition of a job.

	apiVersion: batch/v1
	
	kind: Job
	
	metadata:
	  name: myjob
	
	spec:
	  template:
	    spec:
	      containers:
	      - name: mypod
	        image: richardchesterwood/k8s-fleetman-webapp-angular:release0
	  backoffLimit: 2
	  
What is a cronjob?

-	A cronjob is similar to a job.

-	But it periodically creates a pod according to the schedule.  

-	Following is yaml definition of a cronjob.

	apiVersion: batch/v1beta1

	      backoffLimit: 2

What is a daemonset?

-	A replicaset ensure fixed number of pods running inside the cluster.

-	When a node fails its pod is lost.

-	A replicaset create new pod as replacement on another node. 

-	Also when a node is added to cluster then replicaset will not create a pod inside it.

-	A daemonset is different from replicaset.

-	It will create pod on every node inside the cluster.

-	When a node fails its pod is lost.

-	A daemonset does not create new pod as replacement on another node. 

-	Also when a node is added to cluster then daemonset will create a pod inside it.
