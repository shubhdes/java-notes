helm

What is helm?

-	Helm is a package manager for kubernetes cluster.

-	In helm package is called as chart.

-	Every chart is present inside a repository.

-	Installing a chart means creating kubernetes deployment.

-	Following command is used to add repository to helm.

	syntax:
	
	#helm repo add [name] [url]
	
	example:
	
	#helm repo add myrepo https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
	
-	Following command is used to refresh repository list in helm.

	example:
	
	#helm repo update	

-	Following command is used to install package from repository using helm.
	
	syntax:
	
	#helm install [name] [repo]/[chart]
	
	example:
	
	#helm install myinstall myrepo/mysql	

-	Following command is used to list packages installed on the cluster.
	
	example:
	
	#helm list	

-	Following command is used to uninstall package using helm.
	
	syntax:
	
	#helm uninstall [name]
	
	example:
	
	#helm uninstall myinstall

Explain the file structure in helm chart?

-	mysql
	 |
	 |-- /chart/
	 |
	 |-- /templates/
	 |
	 |-- Chart.yaml
	 |
	 |-- values.yaml

Explain the Chart.yaml file?

-	The Chart.yaml is metadata file.

-	It consist of description about the helm packagae.

Explain the templates folder?

-	Every yaml file present inside the templates folder is read by text processor.

-	The text processor evaluate the go expressions present inside each yaml file.

-	The contents of all yaml files is concated using yaml separator.

-	This concated yaml will create kubernetes deployment.

-	Following command is used to show concated yaml.

	syntax:
	
	#helm template [path]
	
	example:
	
	#helm template /mysql

Explain the values.yaml file?

-	The concated yaml in helm is configured using go expression.

-	A go expressions can be evaluated using parameter.

	example:
	
	replicas : {{ .Values.webapp.replicas }}

-	This parameter is defined inside values.yaml file.

	example:
	
	webapp:
	  replicas: 3

Explain function in go expression?

-	A function call is a go expression.

	syntax:
	
	{{ method param1 param2 ... param n}}
	
	example:
	
	{{ lower .Values.webapp.name }}

	{{ default "myapp" .Values.webapp.name }}		
	
Explain function pipeline in go expression?

-	Function pipeline means function chaining.

-	The result of one function is passed as parameter to another function.

	example:
	
	{{ .Values.webapp.name | default "myapp" | lower}}
	
Explain the conditional statement in go expression?

-	A conditional statement is a go expression.

	syntax:
	
	{{ if condition }} block {{ else }} block {{ end }}
	
	example:
	
	profile: {{ if eq .Values.webapp.profile "dev" }} DEV {{ else }} PROD {{ end }}
	
Explain the named template file in helm?

-	A named template is also called as sub template.

-	A template file exist inside templates folder.

-	Its name begins with _ underscore and extension is tpl.	

-	The text processor ignores file inside templates folder with name beginning with _ underscore.	

-	This file contain common block of yaml required by multiple other yaml files.

	example:
	
	{{- define name -}}
	block
	{{- end -}}  		
	
	example:
	
	{{- define "common" -}}
	name: myapp
	{{- end -}}  		

-	Use of {{- -}} removes blank space and new line before and after the yaml block.	

-	A go expression can be a pointer to yaml block in any tpl file.

	syntax:
	
	{{ include name tag | indent n }}
	
	example:
	
	{{ include "common" . | indent 4 }}

-	We can also use template function but it does not support indent pipeline.
