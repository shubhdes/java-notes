What is a stream?

-	We must use stream processing when we need to take quick action as soon as message record arrives.

-	Also we must not use stream processing when we take decision after analysis of large repository of data.

What is topology?

-	Topology is an arrangement of different components of a system by connecting them to each other.

-	The kafka stream is designed by connecting one or more processor with each other.

-	This transformed message record is now pulled by the next processor.
