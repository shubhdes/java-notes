Why git reset is not recommended to use in public repositories?

-	The git reset command will delete commit history.

-	Hence there may be conflict when a developer uses git reset command and delete commit history.

-	Further if the developer push the changes to remote repository there may be chances of conflict.

Explain the alternative to git reset command?

-	The git revert command is alternative to git reset command.

-	The command will undo changes of commit without deleting the commit history.

-	It will create new commit.

-	The following message must be used to revert commit.

	syntax:
	
	#git revert [commit_id] -m [message]
	
	example:
	
	#git revert 12bab32 -m "revert to second commit"
	
-	There may be chances of merge conflict when we revert in between commit.

-	This merge conflict must be resolved manually.

-	We can use -n or --no-commit option to revert commit but without creating new commit.

	syntax:
	
	#git revert --no-commit [commit_id]
	
	example:
	
	#git revert --no-commit 12bab32
	
-	This will require commit to be done manually.

What is reflog in git?

-	The reflog maintains complete history of all git operations performed in form of logs.

-	Even if a commit is deleted by using git reset command we can restore that commit using git reflog command.

-	This information is maintained in logs for 90 days.

-	The git reflog command maintains complete history of local repository operations and not remote repository operations.

-	To find complete history of local repository operations we need to use following command.

	example:

	#git reflog

-	To find git operations history in particular branch we need to use following command.

	syntax:
	
	#git reflog [branch_name]

	example:

	#git reflog master

-	We can revert to any commit information maintained by reflog using following command.

	syntax:
	
	#git revert [commit_id]

	example:

	#git revert 12fee32
