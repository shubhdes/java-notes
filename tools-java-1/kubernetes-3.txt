What is a resource request?

-	We can define the memory and cpu requirement for a pod.

-	It is optional to include resource request.

-	This helps kubernetes to know whether a node is capable for running a pod.			

-	Following is yaml definition of a memory and cpu requirement.

	resources:
	  requests:
	    memory: 300Mi
		cpu: 100m

What is a resource limit?

-	We can define upper boundary for the memory and cpu requirement for a pod.

-	When the memory usage of container exceed the limit then the container is restarted.

-	The pod will remain alive.

-	When the cpu usage of container exceed the limit then the cpu will throttle.

-	The pod will remain alive also the container will not be restarted.

-	Following is yaml definition of a memory and cpu limit.

	resources:
	  limits:
	    memory: 500Mi
		cpu: 300m

What is a horizontal pod autoscaling?

-	Horizontal pod autoscaling means dynamically changing the number of pod instances.

-	When the number of request increases the number of pod instances are also increased.

-	Also when the number of request decreases the number of pod instances are also decreased.

-	Following is yaml definition of a horizontal autoscaling.

	apiVersion: autoscaling/v1

	kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler

	metadata:
	  name: myhpa

	spec:
	  minReplicas: 1
      maxReplicas: 4
	  
	  scaleTargetRef:
	    apiVersion: apps/v1beta1 
		kind: Deployment
		name: mydep
		
	  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 400
	 
What is a readiness probe?

-	When a container is ready the pod enters into running state.

-	But the application inside container may be in booting state.

-	Then it is not ready to accept any request. It is a downtime situation.

-	The readiness probe help to determine whether a pod is ready to accept any request.

-	Following is yaml definition of a readiness probe.

	readinessProbe:
	  httpGet:
	    path: /
		port: 8080

What is a liveness probe?

-	A liveness probe helps to determine whether a pod is alive.

-	It is called continously.

-	When the liveness probe fail it indicated that the pod is not alive. It is a downtime situation.

-	Then kubernetes will restart the container inside the pod.

-	Following is yaml definition of a readiness probe.

	livenessProbe:
	  httpGet:
	    path: /
		port: 8080
