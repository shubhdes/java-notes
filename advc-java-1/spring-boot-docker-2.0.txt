spring boot - docker-2.0

How does spring boot maven plugin automate image construction?

-	The spring boot maven plugin can be used to automate image construction.

?	This plugin is called after packaging phase of build lifecycle.

-	The plugin supports build pack which means it does not require external Dockerfile.

-	It identifies other required docker images like java development kit and include them in application image.

-	It requires configuration parameters like image name and tag.

-	To create an image the plugin requires several other docker images which it pulls from docker hub.

-	When the pullPolicy is set to IF_NOT_PRESENT the plugin will pull docker images from docker hub for first image construction.

-	It will reuse the same docker images for every next image construction.

	example:
	<plugin>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
		<configuration>
			<image>
				<name>my-repo/my-app:1.0</name>
			</image>
			<pullPolicy>IF_NOT_PRESENT</pullPolicy>
		</configuration>
	</plugin>
